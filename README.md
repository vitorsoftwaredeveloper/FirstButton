In this codelab, you create an interactive Dice Roller app that lets users tap a Button composable to roll a dice. The outcome of the roll is shown with an Image composable on the screen.

You use Jetpack Compose with Kotlin to build your app layout and then write business logic to handle what happens when the Button composable is tapped.
